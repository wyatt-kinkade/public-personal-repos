# public-personal-repos

These are assorted Personal Scripts that I've no issue with making these available to the world. Most are simple and basic, but they're mostly here to perform basic tasks quickly.

Bad news is that this is a downstream repo, I don't update it that often or at least until everything tests well upstream for some time, all that is here currently tests well with Ansible 2.10.
